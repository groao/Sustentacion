Few biologists now doubt that genetical investigation has revealed at any rate the most important categories of hereditary variation; and the classical 'naturalist' theory-the inheritance of acquired characters-has been very generally relegated to the background because, in the forms in which it has been put forward, it has required a type of hereditary variation for the existence of which there was no adequate evidence.},

abstract = {The way in which proteins attain and maintain their final form is of fundamental importance. Recent work has focused on the role of a set of ubiquitous proteins, termed chaperonins, in the assembly of phage and multisubunit proteins. The range of chaperonin action is unknown; they could interact with most cellular polypeptides or have a limited subset of protein partners. Included in the chaperonin family is the essential heat-shock regulated Escherichia coli groEL gene product. Over-expression of the groE operon in E. coli causes enhanced assembly of heterologously expressed ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase subunits and suppresses the heat-sensitive mutant phenotype of several dnaA alleles. It has been inferred that suppression of heat-sensitive mutations is confined to dnaA alleles and that this confinement could reflect an interaction between the groE operon products and a dnaA protein aggregate at the replication origin. We now report that multiple copies of the groE operon suppress mutations in genes encoding several diverse proteins. Our data indicate a general role for the groE operon products, the GroEL and GroES proteins, in the folding-assembly pathways of many proteins.},

IoT aims to offer a common communication paradigm for all objects via the Internet and its protocols. For that reasons, it is being applied in all areas of life, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, military, cities management, and industry. One of the major challenges of the IoT is to integrate IPv6, and its related protocols, into the constrained capabilities offered by Wireless Sensor Networks, building automation, and home appliances. One of the design considerations, for the success of the IoT, is to integrate what exists from IPv6, before creating novel protocols, in order to promote and ensure the interoperability, homogeneity, openness, security, flexibility, and heritage of all existing hardware, tools, and applications of IPv6. This work presents how to integrate the management protocols in IPv6 into the emerging IoT networks based on protocols such as 6LoWPAN. An overview of the different management protocols for IPv6 is presented. Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and the considerations for IoT management from works such as Lightweight Network Management Protocol (LNMP), and the Constrained networks and devices Management (COMAN) Group from the IETF are discussed. COMAN is presenting solutions such as simplified MIB, new SNMP consideration, and CoAP-based management.},

abstract={Real deployments of the IoT require security. CoAP is being standardized as an application layer protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). CoAP proposes to use DTLS to provide end-to-end security to protect the IoT. DTLS is a heavyweight protocol and its headers are too long to fit in a single IEEE802.15.4 MTU. 6LoWPAN provides header compression mechanisms to reduce the size of upper layer headers. 6LoWPAN header compression mechanisms can be used to compress the security headers as well. In this paper we propose 6LoWPAN header compression for DTLS. We link our compressed DTLS with the 6LoWPAN standard using standardized mechanisms. We show that our proposed DTLS compression significantly reduces the number of additional security bits. For example, only for the DTLS Record header that is added in every DTLS packet, the number of additional security bits can be reduced by 62%. Our compressed-DTLS is the first lightweight 6LoWPAN extension for DTLS.},

abstract = {Dynamic address assignment enables nodes in mobile ad hoc networks to obtain a routable address without the need for any explicit configuration. It provides a means for nodes to communicate without any centralized infrastructure and provides a mechanism for dynamic network membership. Recently, a considerable number of dynamic addressing protocols have been proposed. While these approaches bear some similarities to each other, they also differ in some important characteristics. To understand the benefits of these different approaches, it is necessary to test the protocols in a wide range of network conditions so that their performance and suitability can be predicted. This paper studies existing solutions by categorizing and qualitatively analyzing the scalability and other performance properties of the approaches. We also introduce a new addressing approach that provides both quick and efficient unique address assignment. We then compare selected protocols through quantitative analysis based on extensive simulations. Based on the simulation results, we point out the applicability of the protocols and offer suggestions to improve protocol performance. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

ABSTRACT = {The TCP/IP protocol allows the different nodes in a network to communicate by associating a different IP address to each node. In wired or wireless networks with infrastructure, we have a server or node acting as such which correctly assigns IP addresses, but in mobile ad hoc networks there is no such centralized entity capable of carrying out this function. Therefore, a protocol is needed to perform the network configuration automatically and in a dynamic way, which will use all nodes in the network (or part thereof) as if they were servers that manage IP addresses. This article reviews the major proposed auto-configuration protocols for mobile ad hoc networks, with particular emphasis on one of the most recent: D2HCP. This work also includes a comparison of auto-configuration protocols for mobile ad hoc networks by specifying the most relevant metrics, such as a guarantee of uniqueness, overhead, latency, dependency on the routing protocol and uniformity.},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are networks with self-organizing capabilities and without a fixed infrastructure. Wireless nodes communicate among themselves using multi-hop radio relaying, without requiring the packets to pass through a central access point or a base station. Routing is a function of speed and stability with which the nodes are able to acquire addresses. Efficient routing forms the basis of a fast and reliable communication network. In a highly mobile and infrastructure-less scenario, pre-configuration of addresses is not possible. Therefore node addresses need to be configured dynamically with minimum delay and packet loss. The main task of an address auto-configuration protocol is to manage the resource address space. It must be able to select, allocate, and assign a unique network address to an un-configured node. This paper proposes a new address auto-configuration protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The scheme uses virtual address space for addressing new nodes joining a network. The aim is to map one point from virtual address sheet to exactly one new node. The reason for using the term "virtual" is that the whole corresponding address space is a 2D flat sheet and each point of this sheet is virtually mapped to a node in MANET. The protocol uses coordinate values for generating addresses.},

title={Passive duplicate address detection in mobile ad hoc networks}, 
year={2003}, 
volume={3}, 
pages={1504-1509 vol.3}, 
abstract={Auto-configuration of nodes is an important issue in self-organizing mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Especially the property of unique addresses is critical for the main task of a data network: the delivery of packets to the intended destination. Stateless auto-configuration allows a node to construct an address on its own. Duplicate address detection (DAD), usually done by sending a query to the chosen address and waiting for a response, can be used to ensure the uniqueness of this address. The other approach, the distributed assignment of a priori unique address, can also be a bandwidth consuming task in a dynamic environment. In both cases, a merger of two configured networks is very difficult to detect and can lead to duplicate addresses. Thus, a continuous and bandwidth-efficient duplicate address detection mechanism would be eligible. In this paper, the feasibility of a new DAD approach is investigated: the detection of duplicate addresses in a passive way, only by monitoring routing protocol traffic. Based on classic link state routing, three concepts of passive duplicate address detection (PDAD) are proposed. Two link-state protocols currently in discussion in the IETF MANET working group, the fisheye state routing (FSR) protocol and the optimized link state routing (FSR) protocol and the optimized link state routing protocol (OLSR), are analyzed regarding these concepts. Finally, first simulation results are presented.},

Such networks may operate in a stand-alone fashion, or may be connected to the larger Internet. In traditional networks, hosts rely on centralized servers like DHCP for configuration, but this cannot be extended to MANETs because of their distributed and dynamic nature. Many schemes have been proposed to solve this problem. Some of these approaches try to extend the IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration mechanism to MANETs, some use flooding the entire network to come up with a unique IP address, and others distribute IP addresses among nodes (using binary split) so that each node can independently configure new nodes. None of these existing solutions consider network partitioning and merging. In this paper, we propose a proactive scheme for dynamic allocation of IP addresses in MANETs. Our solution also uses the concept of binary split and takes into consideration the previously unsolved issues like partitioning and merging and abrupt departure of nodes from the system. We show that our solution is scalable and does not have the limitations of earlier approaches.},

An unconfigured node should be able to allocate a unique network address in a timely manner. Once a node leaves the network, its address should be reclaimed for future usage. The lack of a central server and hosts’ mobility makes address allocation a challenging task in ad hoc networks. In recent years, various address autoconfiguration protocols have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present an \{IPv6\} address configuration scheme that can allocate \{IPv6\} addresses to the authorized hosts for a MANET. Each host can generate unique \{IPv6\} address from its own \{IPv6\} address and can assign those addresses to the new nodes. The scheme has been implemented in network simulator 3.13 with Ubuntu. Simulation outcome has shown that the scheme is robust and \{IP\} addresses can be allocated to nodes with an acceptable addressing latency and communication overhead. "

All routing protocols assume nodes to be configured a priori with a unique IP address. Unlike infrastructure based networks, MANET supports autonomous and spontaneous networking and therefore, should be capable of self organization and configuration. We present a new address allocation protocol in MANET based on the concept of quadratic residue. Each node in the network is capable of assigning a unique IP address with low latency. Addresses are reclaimed automatically, as the quadratic residues lie in cycles. This saves lot of extra communication overhead and bandwidth. Our approach also has support for network merging and partitioning. The proposed scheme can be applied to large scale MANETs with low communication overhead, even distribution, and low latency.},

abstract={Secure distributed IP addressing is a prime requirement in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) for unicast communication. Several types of security threats have been observed in most of the proposed dynamic addressing approaches as they rely on broadcasting for address solicitation and/ or duplicate address detection. In this paper, we propose an ID based distributed dynamic IP configuration scheme to securely allocate IP addresses to the authorized hosts for a MANET without broadcasting over the entire network. Each host can generate unique IP addresses from its own IP address and can assign those addresses to the new nodes. In addition, we propose a novel signature scheme that authenticates and lessens the security threats associated with dynamic IP configuration. Proof of correctness of the proposed signature scheme verifies that the scheme is secure against any forgery attack. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed addressing scheme has low overhead and fairly good addressing latency with added security mechanisms as compared to similar existing dynamic configuration schemes. Moreover, the proposed scheme is robust and can efficiently solve the problem of network partitions and mergers.},

Moreover, they apply only to ideal networks in which all nodes can trust each other. In this manner, they do absolutely not consider the security aspects and are thus not adapted to a real use. We propose a node autoconfiguration algorithm which uses the Buddy systems technique to allocate the addresses, as well as a scheme allowing to authenticate the participants inside the network.},

abstract={The evolution of M2M (Machine-to-Machine) systems is gaining momentum in recent years. Ubiquitous wireless and wireline connectivity, and declining prices of communication modules are the main drivers of such a positive trend. While the potential market opportunities for M2M are immense, there are still many open issues: global market and standards fragmentation, privacy and security, numerous technological challenges (e.g. device management, network scalability, device authentication on the provider's network, charging rules), as well as incompatible and incomplete regulation policies in different countries. In this paper we give an overview of the current state of the M2M market and standardization efforts in the complex and diverse M2M ecosystem. Standardization bodies (e.g. ETSI, 3GPP, ITU-T) have become more active in the standardization of M2M systems because of its growing market demands. This paper also gives an insight into the regulation processes, with the focus on specific ongoing projects in the USA and in the European Union. Finally, it shows how EU directives are transposed into Croatian legislation and presents one of HAKOM's projects proposed in cooperation with academia, industry, and network operators.},

abstract={Machine-to-machine wireless systems are being standardized to provide ubiquitous connectivity between machines without the need for human intervention. A natural concern of cellular operators and service providers is the impact that these machine type communications will have on current human type communications. Given the exponential growth of machine type communication traffic, it is of utmost importance to ensure that current voice and data traffic is not jeopardized. This article investigates the limits of machine type communication traffic coexisting with human communication traffic in LTE-A networks, such that human customer churn is minimized. We show that under proper design, the outage probability of human communication is marginally impacted whilst duty cycle and access delay of machine type communications are reasonably bounded to ensure viable M2M operations.},

Although there have been early-stage studies in social-driven IoT, they merely use one or some properties of SIoT to improve a number of specific performance variables. Therefore, this paper first addresses a complete view on SIoT and key perspectives to envision the real ubiquitous computing. Thereafter, a literature review is presented along with the evolutionary history of IoT research from Intranet of Things to SIoT. Finally, this paper proposes a generic SIoT architecture and presents a discussion about enabling technologies, research challenges, and open issues.},

Nowadays, research into the IoT has extended this vision to the connectivity of Things to anything, anyone, anywhere and at anytime. The IoT has grown into multiple dimensions, which encompasses various networks of applications, computers, devices, as well as physical and virtual objects, referred to as things or objects, that are interconnected together using communication technologies such as, wireless, wired and mobile networks, RFID, Bluetooth, GPS systems, and other evolving technologies. This paradigm is a major shift from an essentially computer-based network model to a fully distributed network of smart objects. This change poses serious challenges in terms of architecture, connectivity, efficiency, security and provision of services among many others. This paper studies the state-of-the art of the IoT.

All machines are interconnected and communicate through their sensors and actuators as they work their way through the manufacturing process. Operators use wireless pads and connect to production systems for diagnostics and manufacturing oversight. Machine load, status, and diagnosis data are further aggregated in enterprise systems for resource planning and production optimization. The machines receive usage feedback to adjust production schemes and therefore optimize cost and quality. The machines also communicate with their own manufacturers to request repairs or order new parts to avoid costly outages. Agent-based systems allocate load to machines in a distributed, often global, production setup to optimize supply chain cost. This is a growing reality in what we call the smart factory. The smart factory of the future is far more agile than the approaches in today's flexible manufacturing. The smart factory connects the machines, devices, logistics, and humans to perform the necessary coordination ubiquitously and ad hoc.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the convergence of Internet with RFID, Sensor and smart objects. IoT can be defined as “things belonging to the Internet” to supply and access all of real-world information. Billions of devices are expected to be associated into the system and that shall require huge distribution of networks as well as the process of transforming raw data into meaningful inferences. IoT is the biggest promise of the technology today, but still lacking a novel mechanism, which can be perceived through the lenses of Internet, things and semantic vision. This paper presents a novel architecture model for IoT with the help of Semantic Fusion Model (SFM). This architecture introduces the use of Smart Semantic framework to encapsulate the processed information from sensor networks. The smart embedded system is having semantic logic and semantic value based Information to make the system an intelligent system. This paper presents a discussion on Internet oriented applications, services, visual aspect and challenges for Internet of things using RFID, 6lowpan and sensor networks.},

M2M - as a part of the Internet of Things (IoT) - is, at the present, one of the main drivers behind the growth in mobile subscribers, with all of the world's largest electronic communications operators now having several million M2M subscribers in their mobile networks. The M2M communication model is linked to the interaction between IoT endpoints, which represent - from the point of view of business process and end user applications - service end points that can be easily embedded in emerging service oriented enterprise systems and service delivery platforms. To capitalize on the projected expansion of the M2M market, both regulators and telecommunications operators (as well as service providers) will have to be agile and flexible. The challenge of embedding real world information into networks, services and applications through the convergence of domains like Technologies, Electronic Communications and Intelligence - enabled by context aware technologies, nanoelectronics, sensors and cloud computing - will bring about the development of novel services, innovative products, new interfaces and new applications.},

An investigation to determine if any differences exist between information security education, information security training and information security awareness was conducted. This was done to help institutions understand when they need to train or educate employees and when to introduce information security awareness programmes. A conceptual analysis based on the existing literature was used for proposing working definitions, which can be used as a reference point for future information security researchers. Three important attributes (namely focus, purpose and method) were identified as the distinguishing characteristics of information security education, information security training and information security awareness. It was found that these information security concepts are different in terms of their focus, purpose and methods of delivery.},

abstract="Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are a kind of very complex distributed communication systems with wireless mobile nodes that can be freely and dynamically self-organized into arbitrary and temporary network topologies. MANETs inherit several limitations of wireless networks, meanwhile make new challenges arising from the specificity of MANETs, such as route failures, hidden terminals and exposed terminals. When TCP is applied in a MANET environment, a number of tough problems have to be dealt with. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on this dynamic field is given. Specifically, for the first time all factors impairing TCP performance are identified based on network protocol hierarchy, i.e., lossy wireless channel at the physical layer; excessive contention and unfair access at the MAC layer; frail routing protocol at the network layer, the MAC layer and the network layer related mobile node; unfit congestion window size at the transport layer and the transport layer related asymmetric path. How these factors degrade TCP performance is clearly explained. Then, based on how to alleviate the impact of each of these factors listed above, the existing solutions are collected as comprehensively as possible and classified into a number of categories, and their advantages and limitations are discussed. Based on the limitations of these solutions, a set of open problems for designing more robust solutions is suggested.",
